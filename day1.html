      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`);
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Scallops";
      document.write(`Your order of  ${dinnerItem} is ready! Come to the pickup counter now.`);

    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 4;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>



  <p><h2>Now you try it!</h2></p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>
 

<p>
    <script>
      let ownerName;
      let pet1;
      let pet2;
      ownerName = "Jeff";
      pet1 = "dog";
      pet2 = "cat";
      document.write(`Hi, ${ownerName}. Your ${pet1} and ${pet2} need more food.`)
    </script>
 </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let destinationCountry;
      let destinationCity1;
      let destinationCity2;


      destinationCountry = "France";
      destinationCity1 = "Marseille";
      destinationCity2 = "Avignon";

      document.write(`1. If traveling to ${destinationCountry}, visit ${destinationCity1} and ${destinationCity2} for at least two weeks.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let perfectVacation;
      let perfectVacation2;
      let perfectVacation3;

      perfectVacation = "California";
      perfectVacation2 = "New York";
      perfectVacation3 = "Miami";

      document.write(`2. Would you rather go to ${perfectVacation}, ${perfectVacation2}, or ${perfectVacation3} this summer? ${perfectVacation2} is my choice.`)

    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
    
    let fruit1;
    let fruit2;
    let fruit3;

    fruit1 = "rasberries";
    fruit2 = "blueberries";
    fruit3 = "strawberries";

    document.write(`3. I love ${fruit1} and ${fruit2}, but I don't like ${fruit3} at all.`)

    </script>

        let city1 = "New York";
        let city2 = "San Francisco";
        let city3 = "New Orleans";
        let city4 = "Cleveland";

        document.write(`4. America has only three cities: ${city1}, ${city2}, and ${city3}. Everywhere else is ${city4}.   ~Tenneesee Williams `)
    </script>
  </p>

    <script>
        let disaster1= "hurricanes";
        let disaster2= "earth quakes";
        let disaster3= "tornadoes";
        let disaster4= "mass fires";

        document.write(`5. Which frighten you the most; ${disaster1}, ${disaster2}, ${disaster3}, or ${disaster4}?`)
